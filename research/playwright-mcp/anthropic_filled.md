We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

                - textbox "Why Anthropic?" [ref=e286]: I want to work at Anthropic because I believe in the mission of building AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and aligned with human values. Having spent 6+ years building production ML systems—from RAG pipelines serving millions of users at Subway to multi-agent AI trading systems—I've seen firsthand both the transformative potential and the risks of deploying AI at scale. What draws me specifically to the Pre-training team is the opportunity to work at the foundation of what makes Claude possible. My experience optimizing LLM pipelines (reducing token costs by 40% while maintaining <200ms latency) and building systems that coordinate multiple AI models has given me deep appreciation for the engineering challenges in training large language models efficiently and safely. I'm particularly excited by Anthropic's empirical, scientific approach to AI research. The work on Constitutional AI, interpretability, and scaling laws represents exactly the kind of rigorous, safety-focused research I want to contribute to. I've followed Anthropic's research since the early papers on AI safety and have been consistently impressed by the team's commitment to both capability and alignment. As someone who has published 130+ technical articles and built open-source AI systems, I'm eager to join a team where I can both learn from world-class researchers and contribute my practical engineering experience to advance the state of the art in safe AI development.

Examples could include past work, volunteering, civic engagement, community organizing, donations, family support, etc." [ref=e294]: I've dedicated significant time to democratizing AI knowledge through open-source contributions and technical writing. I've published over 130 articles on dev.to covering software engineering and AI deployment, helping thousands of developers understand complex ML concepts. I also built and open-sourced a multi-agent AI trading system (github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading) that demonstrates responsible AI coordination patterns, sharing both the code and detailed documentation to help others learn. This reflects my core value that advancing technology responsibly requires not just building systems, but also sharing knowledge openly so the broader community can participate in shaping how AI is developed and deployed.

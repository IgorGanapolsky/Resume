D-Wave Quantum Hiring Team
Burnaby, BC / Remote US

Re: Software Specialist, Support II (Intermediate)

I'm applying for the Software Specialist, Support II role at D-Wave Quantum. I've spent the last 6+ years building production software systems and deploying ML at scale—from serving 5M+ monthly users at Subway to architecting multi-agent AI platforms.

At Subway, I deployed a RAG pipeline using GPT-4 and Pinecone that reduced token costs by 40% and maintained <200ms latency. I also built a Dialogflow CX conversational AI system on Vertex AI that cut customer service load by 35%. This experience directly translates to supporting customers developing quantum applications—I understand both the technical depth and the customer communication skills required.

What makes my background unique for this role is the combination of customer-facing technical support and deep software expertise. I have strong Python skills, experience with cloud platforms (GCP, AWS), and a passion for helping developers succeed with complex technology. My experience debugging ML systems and explaining technical concepts to diverse audiences aligns perfectly with supporting quantum developers on the Leap platform.

I also built an open-source multi-agent AI trading system (github.com/IgorGanapolsky/trading) that coordinates multiple AI models—demonstrating my ability to work with cutting-edge technology and document complex systems clearly.

I'm drawn to D-Wave because quantum computing represents the next frontier of computation, and your practical approach to delivering value today is exactly the kind of innovation I want to support. As a Florida resident, I'm excited about the Remote US position and the opportunity to help developers access quantum computing.

I'd be excited to discuss how my technical support experience and software background can help D-Wave's customers succeed with quantum applications. Thanks for considering my application.

Best regards,
Igor Ganapolsky

P.S. I publish my work openly at dev.to/igorganapolsky—130+ technical articles on software development and deployment.

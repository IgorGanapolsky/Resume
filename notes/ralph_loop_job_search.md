# Ralph Loop: Job Search / Applications

This file is the rolling queue for ongoing job-search work under `Resume/`.

## Canonical Candidate Info (Needs Confirmation)

- Primary email to use on applications: `iganapolsky@gmail.com`

Until confirmed, applications are taken up to (but not including) the final submit step.

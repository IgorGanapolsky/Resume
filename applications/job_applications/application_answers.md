### What is your ideal tech stack?

```
TypeScript, React, React Native, Node.js, and Python.

At Subway, I've worked extensively with:
- Frontend: React Native (New Architecture with Fabric/TurboModules), React, Next.js
- Backend: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

I'm particularly strong in TypeScript across the full stack and have experience scaling applications serving millions of users at Fortune 500 scale.
```

### What is an example of something you built that you're proud of?

```
I built a production RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) system that runs 26 autonomous AI skills.

Key achievements:
- Thompson Sampling model for continuous learning from user feedback (76.6% positive rate)
- LanceDB hybrid search combining BM25 + vector similarity for semantic memory
- 13 autonomous agents that orchestrate developer workflows
- Reduced API costs by 40-50% through intelligent prompt caching

At Subway, I also led the React Native New Architecture migration achieving:
- 68% build time reduction (26 min → 8-10 min)
- 99.5%+ crash-free sessions maintained across millions of users
- $2M+ annual savings through performance optimizations

The RLHF system represents my passion for building AI that actually learns and improves from real-world usage.
```

### Anything else you'd like to add?

```
I'm excited about Owner.com's mission to help local restaurants compete with big chains. Having worked at Subway (37,000+ locations), I understand the challenges franchise operators face with technology.

Your remote-first culture is exactly what I'm looking for, and I'm ready to contribute immediately from South Florida.

My unique combination of React Native expertise + production AI/ML systems positions me to help Owner build both great mobile experiences and AI-powered features that drive growth for restaurant owners.

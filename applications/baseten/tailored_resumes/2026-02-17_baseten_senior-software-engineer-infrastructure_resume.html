<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Senior AI and Full-Stack Engineer with 15+ years of professional software development experience and 6+ years of significant full-stack development responsibility. Builds and ships production AI systems end-to-end, from architecture and implementation through rollout and iteration, including LLM gateways, tool-using agents, retrieval-augmented workflows, and cloud-native services on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. Partners closely with product, data, and engineering stakeholders to translate ambiguous requirements into reliable integrations, emphasizing observability, cost/latency tradeoffs, and measurable business impact.</p>
<p><strong>AI/LLM SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>
• LLM routing &amp; gateways: Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS), provider fallbacks, cost-aware model selection, prompt/cost controls<br />
• Tools/agents: agentic workflows, tool-using agents, prompt engineering, evaluation &amp; guardrails<br />
• RAG: retrieval-augmented systems, indexing/chunking, relevance tuning, latency/cost tradeoffs<br />
• Cloud AI: Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Build), AWS (Lambda, Bedrock)
</p>
<p><strong>FORWARD-DEPLOYED COMPETENCIES</strong></p>
<p>
• Customer-facing delivery: end-to-end ownership from technical discovery and architecture to implementation, rollout, and iteration<br />
• Integration engineering: API gateways, REST APIs, service integrations, auth/rate limiting, feature flags, production rollout safety<br />
• AI application development: LLM-enabled product features, React Native (New Architecture, Fabric), Node.js, microservices<br />
• Reliability and performance: observability (logs/metrics/traces), fallback behavior, distributed debugging, latency/cost tuning<br />
• Cloud platforms: GCP (Vertex AI, Dialogflow, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Build), AWS (Lambda, Bedrock, S3)<br />
• Communication and leadership: architecture reviews, code review, mentoring engineers, clear technical communication with stakeholders

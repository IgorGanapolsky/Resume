Hiring Team  
Baseten  

Re: Senior Software Engineer - Infrastructure (Posting 1b9ba599-ee9f-4034-83c7-3b4569ef4335)

I'm applying to Baseten because you're solving the exact class of problems I care about: production inference infrastructure where reliability, latency, and cost tradeoffs are non-negotiable.

What I bring that maps to your Infrastructure initiatives:

- LLM gateways and routing: I implemented a multi-model gateway in my open-source trading system that routes via Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS), includes provider fallbacks, and treats cost/latency controls as first-class design constraints.
- Cloud-native delivery: I ship AI-backed services end-to-end on GCP and AWS, building secure, observable workflows (APIs, logging/monitoring, rollout safety) that support production teams.
- Distributed-systems mindset: I approach infra work with concrete failure modes in mind, and I push for instrumentation that makes debugging and performance tuning tractable.

Baseten's work on multi-cloud capacity management and high-performance inference is compelling. I'd love to contribute by strengthening orchestration and observability foundations, and by helping teams ship model-serving features with predictable performance and safe fallbacks.

Subject: Interest in Research Data Scientist

Hello Swayable team,

I am interested in the Research Data Scientist opportunity because I enjoy customer-facing, integration-heavy delivery work.

Why I may be a good fit:
- Led end-to-end delivery of AI features from prototype to production at Subway.
- Built secure APIs and cloud workflows on GCP integrating LLM features with existing services.
- Partnered with product/data stakeholders to define prompts, tools, and escalation rules.

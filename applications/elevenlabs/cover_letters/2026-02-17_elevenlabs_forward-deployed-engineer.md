Hiring Team  
ElevenLabs  

Re: Forward Deployed Engineer - Software Engineer (Ashby 6c4c57c1-ec72-42ba-af3a-eb7aebbde2e6)

I'm applying because I enjoy the forward-deployed problem space: taking a powerful platform, integrating it into real customer environments, and making it work reliably under real constraints (latency, cost, security, and messy integration details).

Why I'm a strong fit:

- Production AI delivery: I've shipped LLM-backed features end-to-end on GCP and AWS, building the APIs, workflows, and instrumentation needed to operate them in production.
- Systems-minded orchestration: In my open-source trading system, I built a multi-model gateway that routes via Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS) with provider fallbacks and cost-aware selection, treating cost/latency controls as first-class.
- Clear cross-functional communication: I’m comfortable translating requirements into concrete technical plans and providing crisp updates to both engineers and stakeholders.

I’d love to help ElevenLabs accelerate enterprise deployments by improving integration ergonomics, observability, and operational reliability for customer-facing workflows.

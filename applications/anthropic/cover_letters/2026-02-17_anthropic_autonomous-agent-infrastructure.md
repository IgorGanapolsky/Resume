Hiring Team  
Anthropic  

Re: Senior / Staff+ Software Engineer, Autonomous Agent Infrastructure (Job ID 5065894008)

I'm applying to Anthropic because your focus on safe, production-grade agent systems aligns with what I build day-to-day: reliable AI services that can operate with clear guardrails, measurable quality, and predictable cost/latency.

Highlights that map directly to autonomous agent infrastructure:

- Production agentic workflows: I build and ship LLM-backed systems with tool-use patterns, evaluation/guardrails, and pragmatic fallback behavior so systems degrade safely.
- Routing and cost/latency control: In my open-source trading system, I implemented a multi-model LLM gateway that routes via Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS) with provider fallbacks and cost-aware model selection, treating reliability and cost as first-class constraints.
- Cloud-native engineering: I deliver AI features end-to-end on GCP and AWS, designing APIs and workflows that are secure, observable, and maintainable.

What I would bring to this role is an "infra-first" mindset for agents: make it easy for researchers and product engineers to safely run tool-using agents in production by standardizing execution boundaries, observability, and rollout mechanics.

Thanks for your time. I'd love to discuss how my experience building LLM gateways, agent workflows, and production reliability systems can help Anthropic scale autonomous agents responsibly.

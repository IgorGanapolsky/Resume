## Description

**Mercor is hiring experienced Software Engineers** to support high-impact research collaborations with leading AI labs. Freelancers will contribute to building evaluation datasets that assess AI reasoning, explanation quality, and technical judgment in coding-related interactions.

This is a unique opportunity to apply your engineering expertise toward shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.

### About the Project

This evaluation dataset is code question and answer data. This data is designed to assess natural-language reasoning, explanation quality, and technical judgment in coding-related interactions, rather than executable correctness. Tasks are structured as chat-pasteable prompts that reflect realistic developer questions and include all necessary context inline (e.g., code snippets, error messages, logs, or requirements)

### Key Responsibilities

- Craft realistic developer prompts across multiple categories (code review, debugging, error diagnosis, configuration, and more)
    
- Source and adapt content from real PRs to create authentic scenarios
    
- Write clear, technically accurate model responses that demonstrate strong reasoning and explanation quality
    

### Ideal Qualifications

- 2+ years of experience in software engineering, technical research, or educational content development
    
- Degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field (Bachelor’s minimum; advanced degree preferred)
    
- Strong proficiency in languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++
    
- Experience with debugging, testing, and validating code
    
- Comfortable with technical writing and attention to detail
    

### Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** Immediate
    
- **Duration:** 1-2 months
    
- **Commitment:** Part-time (15–25 hours/week, with flexibility up to 40 hours/week)
    

### Application & Onboarding Process

1. Upload your resume
    
2. AI interview: A short, 15-minute conversational session to understand your background, experience, and interest in the role
    
3. Follow-up communication within a few days with next steps and onboarding details
    

**Apply today** and leverage your software engineering expertise to help build the future of AI-driven systems!

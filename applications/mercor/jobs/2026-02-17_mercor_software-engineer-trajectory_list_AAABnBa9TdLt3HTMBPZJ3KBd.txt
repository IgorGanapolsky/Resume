Freelancers will contribute to building training datasets that improve AI model reasoning and problem-solving on real-world coding tasks.
This is a unique opportunity to apply your software engineering expertise toward shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.
About the Project
You'll annotate frontier-model trajectories on SWE-bench–style tasks derived from real open-source repositories. Currently, closed-source models do not expose their internal reasoning traces, making it difficult to understand how LLMs approach problem-solving.
To address this gap, you'll reconstruct and annotate the reasoning portions of model trajectories—using your own problem-solving process and the full task context to infer and infill the underlying thought process at each step.
Key Responsibilities


Review model-generated code trajectories on realistic software engineering tasks


Reconstruct chain-of-thought reasoning that explains each step of the solution process


Annotate decision points, debugging logic, and problem-solving strategies


Use full task context (codebase, issue descriptions, test cases) to infer plausible reasoning


Ensure annotations reflect realistic developer thought processes and technical accuracy


Ideal Qualifications


2+ years of experience in software engineering, with hands-on debugging and problem-solving in real codebases


Degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field (Bachelor's minimum; advanced degree preferred)


Strong proficiency in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, or other common languages found in open-source projects


Familiarity with version control workflows (Git, PRs, issue tracking)


Comfortable articulating technical reasoning in clear, structured writing


Project Timeline


Start Date: Immediate


Duration: 1–2 months


Commitment: Part-time (15–25 hours/week, with flexibility up to 40 hours/week)


Application & Onboarding Process


Upload your resume


AI interview: A short, 15-minute conversational session to understand your background, experience, and interest in the role


Follow-up communication within a few days with next steps and onboarding details

Reviewers remain hourly with no change. Writer pay is a fixed payout per baselining task rather than hourly. Your payout depends on two factors: the number of review cycles (revision rounds requested after your submission) and your weekly task throughput (number of tasks completed that week).\n\n**Base Rates:** Tasks accepted on the first or second review (0-1 cycles) pay $70 base, or $120 with the throughput bonus. Tasks requiring 2 review cycles are discarded and pay $0.\n\n**Throughput Bonus:** Complete 8+ tasks per week and earn an additional $50 of weekly earnings on top of your base rate. Fewer revisions + higher volume = higher earnings.\n\n**Weekly Earning Examples** (assuming 4 tasks/day × 5 days = 20 tasks/week, qualifying for throughput bonus):\n\n*Example 1 (mostly first-pass approvals):* 18 tasks approved + 2 discarded = $1,260 base + $50 bonus = **$1,310/week ($68,120/year)**.\n\n*Example 2 (balanced mix):* 14 tasks approved + 6 discarded = $980 base + $50 bonus = **$1,030/week ($53,560/year)**.\n\n*Example 3 (more revision-heavy):* 10 tasks approved + 10 discarded = $700 base + $50 bonus = **$750/week ($39,000/year)**.\n\n**Pay Structure:** Tasks will be paid on a weekly basis. Hours will be functionally uncapped and set at 40hr/week—let an EPM know if you'd like this increased. Hourly pay will show as $0/hr since pay has shifted from hourly to per-task. Writers should continue to log hours via Insightful regardless, or else we risk accidental pausing/offboarding.","timeToAutoReject":1209600,"automaticRejectionsOn":true,"companyDescription":null,"sumMinHeadcountGoals":null,"activeContractorsCount":null,"latestHeadcountGoalDeadline":null,"listingOwners":null},"candidateStatus":null,"nextSeoProps":{"title":"Software Engineer (Trajectory) - Mercor Jobs","description":"Mercor is hiring experienced Software Engineers to support high-impact research collaborations with leading AI labs.

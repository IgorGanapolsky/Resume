**Why This Role Exists**

Mercor is supporting a high-priority data collection initiative aimed at improving how AI systems understand complex software interfaces and real-world, multi-step workflows.

- Record screen sessions demonstrating specific tasks, accompanied by clear verbal narration explaining each step
    
- Annotate screenshots of professional software by drawing precise bounding boxes around relevant UI elements
    
- Follow provided staging instructions to set up specific UI states prior to recording
    
- Use a custom capture tool to record workflows accurately and consistently
    
- Adhere closely to task guidelines to ensure data quality and usability

    - Word
        
    - PowerPoint
        
    - Excel
        
- You are detail-oriented and capable of following precise instructions
    
- You are comfortable working independently and meeting tight deadlines
    
- You have access to a physical Mac and can create a fresh macOS user profile if required
    

**Nice-to-Have**

- Prior experience with data collection, annotation, or QA work
    
- Experience recording or documenting workflows

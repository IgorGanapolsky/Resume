Why This Role Exists
Mercor is supporting a high-priority data collection initiative aimed at improving how AI systems understand complex software interfaces and real-world, multi-step workflows. Current datasets lack the fidelity and expert grounding needed to reflect authentic professional software usage. This project addresses that gap by collecting high-quality screen annotations and screen recordings performed by experienced domain experts working in real digital environments.
What You’ll Do
Depending on the task phase, you may be asked to complete one or both of the following:


Record screen sessions demonstrating specific tasks, accompanied by clear verbal narration explaining each step


Annotate screenshots of professional software by drawing precise bounding boxes around relevant UI elements


Follow provided staging instructions to set up specific UI states prior to recording


Use a custom capture tool to record workflows accurately and consistently


Adhere closely to task guidelines to ensure data quality and usability


Who You Are


You have strong familiarity with professional software tools used in your domain including:


Word


PowerPoint


Excel




You are detail-oriented and capable of following precise instructions


You are comfortable working independently and meeting tight deadlines


You have access to a physical Mac and can create a fresh macOS user profile if required


Nice-to-Have


Prior experience with data collection, annotation, or QA work


Experience recording or documenting workflows


Comfort working with new tools and staged environments


What Success Looks Like


Screen annotations are precise, consistent, and aligned with guidelines


Screen recordings accurately capture realistic, expert workflows


Tasks are completed efficiently while maintaining high quality


Collected data is usable at scale for downstream AI research and development


We consider all qualified applicants without regard to legally protected characteristics and provide reasonable accommodations upon request.Contract and Payment Terms

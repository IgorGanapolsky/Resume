## Description

**Mercor is hiring experienced Software Engineers** to support high-impact research collaborations with leading AI labs. Freelancers will contribute to building training datasets that improve AI model reasoning and problem-solving on real-world coding tasks.

This is a unique opportunity to apply your software engineering expertise toward shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.

### About the Project

You'll annotate frontier-model trajectories on **SWE-bench–style tasks** derived from real open-source repositories. Currently, closed-source models do not expose their internal reasoning traces, making it difficult to understand how LLMs approach problem-solving.

To address this gap, you'll **reconstruct and annotate the reasoning portions** of model trajectories—using your own problem-solving process and the full task context to infer and infill the underlying thought process at each step.

### Key Responsibilities

- Review model-generated code trajectories on realistic software engineering tasks
    
- Reconstruct chain-of-thought reasoning that explains each step of the solution process
    
- Annotate decision points, debugging logic, and problem-solving strategies
    
- Use full task context (codebase, issue descriptions, test cases) to infer plausible reasoning
    
- Ensure annotations reflect realistic developer thought processes and technical accuracy
    

### Ideal Qualifications

- 2+ years of experience in software engineering, with hands-on debugging and problem-solving in real codebases
    
- Degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field (Bachelor's minimum; advanced degree preferred)
    
- Strong proficiency in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, or other common languages found in open-source projects
    
- Familiarity with version control workflows (Git, PRs, issue tracking)
    
- Comfortable articulating technical reasoning in clear, structured writing
    

### Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** Immediate
    
- **Duration:** 1–2 months
    
- **Commitment:** Part-time (15–25 hours/week, with flexibility up to 40 hours/week)
    

### Application & Onboarding Process

1. Upload your resume
    
2. AI interview: A short, 15-minute conversational session to understand your background, experience, and interest in the role
    
3. Follow-up communication within a few days with next steps and onboarding details
    

**Apply today** and leverage your software engineering expertise to help build the future of AI-driven systems!

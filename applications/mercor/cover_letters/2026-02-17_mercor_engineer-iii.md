Mercor Team,

I'm applying for the Software Engineer III role. I have 15+ years of professional software development experience, including building, testing, and maintaining production systems across mobile and cloud.

Highlights aligned to the role:
- **Design, implement, test, maintain:** shipped end-to-end features and services with a focus on clean interfaces, maintainability, and reliability.
- **Cross-functional execution:** partnered with product, design, and infrastructure to deliver scoped outcomes.
- **Operational readiness:** comfortable troubleshooting, debugging, and supporting systems with security and privacy best practices.

I'm interested in this opportunity because it matches how I work best: pragmatic engineering execution with strong communication and a bias toward high-quality delivery.

Best regards,
Igor Ganapolsky

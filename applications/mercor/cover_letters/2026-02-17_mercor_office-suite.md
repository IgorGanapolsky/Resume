Mercor Team,

I'm applying for the Software Expert (Office Suite) role. I'm a senior software engineer with a strong detail-oriented execution style: following precise guidelines, reproducing UI states, verifying outcomes, and documenting workflows clearly.

Why I'm a fit:
- **Precision and consistency:** experienced working from requirements/checklists and producing high-quality deliverables.
- **Workflow documentation:** comfortable recording step-by-step demonstrations with clear narration and writing clear instructions.
- **Environment readiness:** I have access to a physical Mac and can work in staged environments or fresh macOS user profiles as needed.

I'm excited about contributing to high-fidelity UI workflow data that can improve how AI systems understand real-world software usage.

Best regards,
Igor Ganapolsky

Mercor Team,

I'm applying for the Software Engineer (Trajectory) role. I'm a senior software engineer with 15+ years of experience, and I'm particularly strong at reconstructing and communicating *how* and *why* a solution progresses: what was observed, what hypotheses were tested, what changed, and how the fix was verified.

What I bring:
- **Hands-on debugging in real codebases:** experience with issue reproduction, root-cause analysis, and verification via tests and observability.
- **Version-control fluency:** comfortable working from PR context (diffs, review comments), issue trackers, and commit history.
- **Structured technical writing:** clear, accurate annotations that reflect realistic developer workflows and decision points.

This role is a great match for my strengths: turning full task context (code, tests, logs, requirements) into high-signal explanations that help evaluate technical reasoning and judgment.

Best regards,
Igor Ganapolsky

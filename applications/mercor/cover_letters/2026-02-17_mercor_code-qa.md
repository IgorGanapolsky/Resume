Mercor Team,

I'm applying for the Software Engineer (Code QA) role. My background combines senior-level software engineering with a strong code-quality and technical-writing mindset: debugging production issues, reviewing changes for correctness and maintainability, and documenting clear reasoning and fixes.

Relevant experience:
- **Debugging and validation at scale:** shipped and supported production systems across mobile and cloud, with an emphasis on reliability and verification.
- **CI/CD and automation:** built and maintained CI workflows (GitHub Actions, Cloud Build) and quality gates that catch regressions early.
- **Clear technical explanations:** comfortable turning real-world context (PR diffs, error logs, config, and requirements) into precise prompts and technically correct, readable responses.

I'm excited about this project because it focuses on evaluation data that measures *engineering judgment and explanation quality* rather than only executable correctness. That's exactly the part of software engineering I care about: making decisions explicit and helping others understand tradeoffs.

Best regards,
Igor Ganapolsky

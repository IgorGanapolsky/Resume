Subject: Interest in AI Infrastructure Engineering Opportunities

Hello PaleBlueDot AI team,

I am interested in AI infrastructure opportunities at PaleBlueDot AI. My work has focused on production software engineering for AI systems, including reliability, platform integration, and backend services.

If and when AI infrastructure roles open, I would value the chance to be considered. I can contribute across system design, implementation, and operational hardening.

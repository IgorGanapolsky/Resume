Back to jobsMember of Technical Staff, InferenceRemoteApplyWe are building AI to simulate the world through merging art and science.We believe that world models are at the frontier of progress in artificial intelligence. Language models alone won’t solve the world’s hardest problems – robotics, disease, scientific discovery. Real progress requires models that experience the world and learn from their mistakes, the same way that humans do. And this kind of trial and error can be massively accelerated when done in simulation, rather than in the real world.World models offer the most clear path to general-purpose simulation, changing how stories are told, how scientific progress is made and how the next frontiers of humanity are reached.
Our team consists of creative, open minded, caring and ambitious people who are determined to change the world. We aspire to continuously build impossible things and our ability to do so relies on building an incredible team. If you are driven to do the same, we'd love to hear from you.About the role 
We're looking for an ML infrastructure engineer to bridge the gap between research and production at Runway. You'll work directly with our research teams to productionize cutting-edge generative models—taking checkpoints from training to staging to production, ensuring reliability at scale, and building the infrastructure that enables fast iteration.
You'll be embedded within research teams, providing platform support throughout the entire model development lifecycle. Your work will directly impact how quickly we can ship new models and features to millions of users.
A peek at our technical stack
Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management is written in TypeScript, and runs in ECS containers on AWS Fargate. We leverage multiple AWS-native components, such as S3, CloudFront, Lambda, Kinesis, and SQS, as building blocks of our infrastructure.
Our inference backend is written in Python (PyTorch, TorchScript), and is deployed across multiple clusters / cloud providers. We use Kubernetes for container orchestration, and k8s-native components such as Flyte, Kueue, and Kyverno efficient job orchestration. We invest in prometheus and grafana for monitoring, and Terraform to manage our infrastructure.
What you’ll do 

Productionize model checkpoints end-to-end: from research completion to internal testing to production deployment to post-release support
Build and optimize inference systems for large-scale generative models running on multi-GPU environments
Design and implement model serving infrastructure specialized for diffusion models and real-time diffusion workflows
Add monitoring and observability for new model releases—track errors, throughput, GPU utilization, and latency
Embed with research teams to gather training data, run preprocessing scripts, and support the model development process
Explore and integrate with GPU inference providers (Modal, E2E, Baseten, etc.)

What you’ll need

4+ years of experience running ML model inference at scale in production environments
Strong experience with PyTorch and multi-GPU inference for large models
Experience with Kubernetes for ML workloads—deploying, scaling, and debugging GPU-based services
Comfortable working across multiple cloud providers and managing GPU driver compatibility
Experience with monitoring and observability for ML systems (errors, throughput, GPU utilization)
Self-starter who can work embedded with research teams and move fast
Strong systems thinking and pragmatic approach to production reliability
Humility and open mindedness; at Runway we love to learn from one another

Nice to Have

Experience building custom inference frameworks or serving systems
Deep understanding of distributed training and inference patterns (FSDP, data parallelism, tensor parallelism)
Ability to debug low-level issues: NCCL networking problems, CUDA errors, memory leaks, performance bottlenecks
Experience with diffusion models or video generation systems
Knowledge of real-time or latency-sensitive ML applications

Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.
Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.

  Partial or complete paralysis (any cause)
  Pulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema
  Short stature (dwarfism)
  Traumatic brain injury

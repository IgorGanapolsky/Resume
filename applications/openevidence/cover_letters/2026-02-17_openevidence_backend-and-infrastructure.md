Hiring Team  
OpenEvidence  

Re: Software Engineer, Backend and Infrastructure (Ashby 4ca13c92-2a6f-4847-8bcd-22aa8b29cde8)

I'm applying because OpenEvidence is building a high-trust, high-availability product in a domain where correctness and reliability matter. My background sits at the intersection of backend systems and production AI: shipping LLM-backed services with clear guardrails, predictable latency/cost behavior, and strong observability.

Relevant experience:

- Production AI infrastructure: I build cloud-native AI services on GCP and AWS, designing APIs and workflows that are secure, observable, and maintainable.
- Routing + cost/latency control: In my open-source trading system, I implemented a multi-model LLM gateway that routes via Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS) with provider fallbacks and cost-aware selection.
- Distributed-systems mindset: I prioritize instrumentation and failure-mode thinking so debugging and performance tuning are tractable in production.

I'd love to help OpenEvidence scale backend and infrastructure systems that keep the product fast, reliable, and safe as usage grows.

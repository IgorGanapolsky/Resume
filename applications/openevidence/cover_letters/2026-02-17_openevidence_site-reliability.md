Hiring Team  
OpenEvidence  

Re: Software Engineer, Site Reliability (Ashby e4cb00ad-9d09-47f8-a67c-5452a1739a11)

I'm applying because OpenEvidence is operating in a domain where uptime, latency, and trustworthy behavior are core product requirements. I build production AI systems with an infra-first mindset: reliability and observability are design inputs, not afterthoughts.

Where I can contribute immediately:

- Reliability/observability: I build services with measurable SLOs, practical alerting, and instrumentation that accelerates root-cause analysis in distributed systems.
- Cost/latency control for AI workloads: In my open-source trading system, I implemented a multi-model gateway that routes via Tetrate Agent Router Service (TARS), supports provider fallbacks, and treats cost/latency controls as first-class.
- Production delivery: I ship end-to-end on GCP and AWS, including automation and rollout safety patterns.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I'd approach SRE for AI-backed systems: hardening critical paths, improving debuggability, and keeping cost predictable under load.

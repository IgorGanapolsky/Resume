You will architect and scale core systems, including service reliability and data platforms with autonomy to shape performance, security, and infrastructure design for sensitive medical data. We hire exceptional builders, not in narrow lanes. Engineers work across products and projects, owning work wherever they can create the most impact.About Us OpenEvidence is the most widely used medical AI platform in the world. In just over a year, our usage has grown to >40% of US clinicians via product-led word of mouth adoption. We are a $12B company with a 30-person engineering team from MIT, Harvard, and Stanford. We believe world-changing products come from a small group of exceptional, autonomous builders, organized along focused objectives and empowered to take individual ownership and run fast. We are growing our team to seize a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to define the default platform for medical AI.If you are a world-class engineer or scientist looking to define the bleeding edge and deliver concrete outcomes that impact hundreds of millions of lives, we want to talk.CultureWe believe work should be engaged with at a world-class level.

Subject: Interest in Simulation Platform Engineering Opportunities

Hello Simile team,

I am reaching out through your careers page to express interest in engineering opportunities aligned with your simulation platform mission. My background is in AI systems and software engineering, with hands-on experience building production AI workflows and infrastructure.

I am especially interested in work that combines agentic systems, rigorous evaluation, and reliable platform engineering. Simile's focus on turning foundational research into practical tools is closely aligned with how I like to operate.
